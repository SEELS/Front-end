		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>
			Usually products are consumed at a point different from the point of production, and they need to be transported to the point of consumption, passing by several logistic zones which make them subject to loss or damage, being transported from a position to another and by different drivers with different driving attitudes, which makes cargo safety a critical issue for any logistics management system. 
			This chain of transportation makes both the transportation companies and the consumers continuously seeking the best transportation methods to ensure the safety of the transported products and minimize the risk of cargo loss. 
			SEELS (Smart End-to-End Logistic System), an IoT based solution, provides transportation companies with methods to track the trucks and products spatially and temporally, and procedures to rate the driver based on his behavior and adherence to basic driving rules while driving.
